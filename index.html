            <h2>My Favorite Author</h2>
            <h3>Fyodor Dostoyevsky</h3>
            <img src="images/dostoyevsky.jpg" alt="Dostoyevsky">
            <p>Fyodor Dostoyevsky was born on October 30, 1821 in Moscow, Russia. He was, in my opinion the defining author of his generation.
                His works focus heavily on the human condition, and at their essence are deeply Christian. Despite Dostoyevsky's faith, he presents great arguments in his books.
                He strengthens his arguments for God by arguing against religion in his novels. My favourite novel of his is The Brothers Karamazov.
                In this novel we follow three brothers, all of who differ greatly. Ivan is an intellectual and an atheist. Alyosha is deeply religious. He is a monk in the monastery
                and is presented as a pure Christ-like figure. The third brother, Mitya is a sensualist and a sinner who struggles with his fate. 
                Dostoyevsky is a master at crafting characters and his works speak to the soul. Everyone should try at least one of his books during their life.</p>

            <h2>Why You Should Read</h2>
            <p>
                Reading is crucial for a healthy mind. In the same way that you should exercise in order to maintain your bodily health,
                I believe that it is just as crucial to read, to build your intelligence and also, it is really enjoyable when you read books
                that you actually like. I am a firm believer that everyone should read and that it's just a matter of finding the right book.
                So please, if you haven't read in a while — give it a try!
            </p>
